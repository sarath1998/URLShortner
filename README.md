# URLShortner
This program will give a brief idea on how a URL shortner works.

In general an URL shortner should simulate a bijective funtion(in mathematics).
But the current code will generate short url, but it will fetch the respective long url from maps
instead of conventional method of rrconverting back to the Long URL.

Each long URL will have an id. Uses this id as a base, generate the short url.

I used a simple logic to generate the shorter Url, but this can be made much complex as well.
